  - *Student*: Handles borrowing rules and fines.

- **Transaction**: Tracks borrow/return dates, fines, and associations.

## Data Persistence

Stored in four text files:
- `books.txt`: Book details and statuses.  
- `users.txt`: User credentials and roles.  
- `accounts.txt`: Fines, transaction counts.  
- `transactions.txt`: Borrow/return records.

## Notes

- Dates are system-generated (modifiable in code).  
- Fines apply only to students.  
- Faculty lose privileges if any book is 60+ days overdue.
